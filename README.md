# Simple Emergency Room
## Overview
This project implements an Emergency Room Management System using a Priority Queue to manage patient queues. The system supports two types of data structures to handle the queue: a simple list-based priority queue and a more efficient max-heap-based priority queue. The project includes functionalities for enqueuing and dequeuing patients based on their priority, along with performance comparisons between the two implementations.
